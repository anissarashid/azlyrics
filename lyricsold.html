				I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert<br>
				Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp<br>
				That right there could drive a sane man berserk<br>
				Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk<br>
				How do you console my mom or give her light support<br>
				Telling her her son's on life support?<br>
				And just imagine how my girl feel<br>
				On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till<br>
				She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine<br>
				She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign<br>
				No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed<br>
				Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines<br>
				In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died<br>
				The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man<br>
				Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band<br>
				I swear this right here, history in the making, man<br><br>
